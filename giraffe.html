                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
       <p>The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus Giraffa.
        It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant on Earth. 
        It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi. 
        Traditionally, giraffes have been thought of as one species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. 
        Most recently, researchers proposed dividing them into four extant species which can be distinguished by their fur coat patterns. 
        Six valid extinct species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.</p>

     <p>The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. 
        Its scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east.
        Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.
        Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males but are gregarious and may gather in large groups.
        Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.</p>

   <p>Gorillas are large, primarily herbivorous,[1] great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
    The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. 
    The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobos and chimpanzees.</p>

   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the giraffes at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
