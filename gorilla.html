                <h3>Gorilla</h3>
       <p>Gorillas are large, primarily herbivorous,[1] great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.
         The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. 
         The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 96 to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest living relatives to humans after the bonobos and chimpanzees.</p>

     <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25 and 1.8 m (4 ft 1 in and 5 ft 11 in), weights between 100 and 270 kg (220 and 600 lb), and arm spans up to 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in), depending on species and sex. 
        They tend to live in troops, with the leader being called a silverback. 
        The eastern gorilla is distinguished from the western by darker fur colour and some other minor morphological differences. 
        Gorillas tend to live 35 to 40 years in the wild.</p>
   <p>There are thought to be around 316,000 western gorillas in the wild, and 5,000 eastern gorillas. 
    Both species are classified as Critically Endangered by the IUCN; all subspecies are classified as Critically Endangered with the exception of the mountain gorilla, which is classified as Endangered. 
    There are many threats to their survival, such as poaching, habitat destruction, and disease, which threaten the survival of the species. 
    However, conservation efforts have been successful in some areas where they live..</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gorilla at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
